# Riddle

A prison counts 100 prisoners.
Each prisoner is isolated in their own cell and all forms of communications are prohibited (with one exception, see below.)
There is one common room with one lamp which is connected to a light switch.

Each day, a guard randomly picks a prisoner (the same prisoner can be picked multiple times).
The prisoner is brought to the common room and given the choice to turn the switch on, off, or leave it be.
Afterwards, the prisoner is brought back to his cell.
Initially, the light is off.

When a prisoner enters the room, he can also claim "Each prisoner has visited the room at least once."
If this is true, all prisoners are released, otherwise they are all executed.
Therefore, it is in a prisoner's best interest to make this claim when they are 100% certain they are right.

The day before this process, all prisoners are allowed to sit together to settle on a strategy.
This is the only time they can communicate freely.

Which strategy should the prisoners follow so that they are all released after a finite amount of time?
