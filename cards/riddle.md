# Riddle

This is a logic puzzle which allows you to check your solution using Python.

Alice and Bob have once again been imprisoned under the watch of a crazy logician warden
who promises to let them free if they can solve the puzzle or otherwise they face a terrible fate.

The warden picks five cards from a standard playing card deck and gives them to Alice.
Alice may stack the cards in any order then give them back to the warden.
The warden will give the top four cards of the stack to Bob.
Bob must now deduce which card the warden is still holding.
Alice and Bob may discuss strategy beforehand but once the process starts
they can only communicate via the special order of cards Alice gives back to the warden.

Can you help Alice and Bob escape this time?
